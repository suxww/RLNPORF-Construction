### Methodsï¼š
Human reference genome (hg38, v103)  and the annotation information were download from Ensembl database  (genome: http://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-103/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/; GTF: http://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-103/gtf/homo_sapiens/). Genome wide putative ORFs were predicted by Ribotricer (v.1.3.2) (https://github.com/smithlabcode/ribotricer), the putative results included location and classification information such as: genome location, chromosome, transcript information, classification of transcript, start codon, etc. ncRNA and cDNA sequence were also downloaded from Ensembl database (http://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-103/fasta/homo_sapiens/), then the ORFs sequence were extracted from the fasta file based on their start and end location, finally the amino acid sequence were generated by micropan (v.2.1). Length of ORFs and amino acids were calculated for the following length filter. ORFs with four typical start codon (ATG/CTG/GTG/TTG) and length range from 10 to 250 amino acids were filtered as the final sORFs putative database.
